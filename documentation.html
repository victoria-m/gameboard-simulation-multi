      <h2>How to Start</h2>

      <p>
        If you would like to change the simulation speed (measured in frames per second),
        select a value from the dropdown list. Then click the 'Start Game' button.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        Pretend there is a 10 by 10 grid sketched out on a metal wall. You place a red and a blue
        marker on opposite corners of the grid. The markers take turns moving around randomly on the
        grid. The first marker to reach its destination wins.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gameboard-simulation</code> animates this scenario, updating the gameboard each time
        a marker moves and displaying results when the game ends. The red marker starts in the lower
        left corner and the blue one starts in the upper right. The game ends once the red marker
        reaches the upper right corner, the blue marker reaches the lower right corner, or each
        marker has moved over a million times.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would like to note that I have rewritten most of my JavaScript code from the first project.
        I changed the way I define properties and methods for my objects to improve readability.
        In my updated code, I attach methods to objects using the <code>prototype</code> keyword.
      </p>

      <p>
        My partner for this project was Stetson Williams. We modified my code from homework 2 to
        create a paint blob dropping simulation, which he may have referred to for his homework 3.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The markers take turns to move</li>
        <li>Red moves first</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a marker lands on a cell already occupied by another marker, the marker that gets
            landed on is sent all the way back to its "home" cell. This only happens for the FINAL
            cell of a marker's move, not any intermediate cell.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Randomly choose a <code>direction</code>: up, down, left, or right. Each direction should
            be equally likely to be chosen. This is accomplished in the <code>Marker</code> object's
            <code>prepareForMove</code> method.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Randomly choose a number of <code>steps</code>, either 0, 1, or 2. Each of these should be
            equally likely over the long haul. Similarly to <code>direction</code>, this is done in
            the <code>Marker</code>'s' <code>prepareForMove</code> method.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <code>Marker</code> object's <code>direction</code> and <code>steps</code> properties
            give us information about where the marker will move next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to move the marker whose turn it is currently using <code>Marker</code>'s <code>move</code>
            method. If that move would take you off the grid, go to the next step without moving the
            marker. Store each successful move's coordinates within a <code>Cell</code> object inside
            <code>Marker</code>'s' <code>history</code> array.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the other marker hasn't exceeded 1,000,000 moves (the marker has to actually move for it to count),
            it is then that marker's turn.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>
        After the simulation is complete, the following information will be displayed below the animation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Winner</li>
        <li>Reason why Game Ended</li>
        <li>Grid showing number of times each cell was touched by the markers</li>
        <li>Maximum number of touches for any cell</li>
        <li>Average number of touches for any cell</li>
        <li>Number of times red marker moved</li>
        <li>Number of times blue marker moved</li>
        <li>Number of times red marker was sent home</li>
        <li>Number of times blue marker was sent home</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This information is contained within a <code>Result</code> object, and the majority of the
        data, apart from <code>gameEndReason</code> and <code>winner</code> is processed after the game ends.
      </p>
