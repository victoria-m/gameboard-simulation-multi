      <h2>How to Start</h2>

      <p>
        If you would like to change the simulation speed (measured in frames per second),
        select a value from the dropdown list. Then click the 'Start Game' button.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        Pretend there is a 10 by 10 grid sketched out on a metal wall. You place a red and a blue
        marker on opposite corners of the grid. The markers take turns moving around randomly on the
        grid. The first marker to reach its destination wins.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gameboard-simulation</code> animates this scenario, updating the gameboard each time
        a marker moves and displaying results when the game ends. The red marker starts in the lower
        left corner and the blue one starts in the upper right. The game ends once the red marker
        reaches the upper right corner, the blue marker reaches the lower right corner, or each
        marker has moved over a million times.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would like to note that I have rewritten most of my JavaScript code from the first project.
        I changed the way I define properties and methods for my objects to improve readability.
        In my updated code, I attach methods to objects using the <code>prototype</code> keyword.
      </p>

      <p>
        My partner for this project was Stetson Williams. We modified my code from homework 2 to
        create a paint blob dropping simulation, which he may have referred to for his homework 3.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>

      <ul>
        <ol></ol>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Randomly choose a <code>direction</code>: up, down, left, or right. Each direction should
            be equally likely to be chosen. This is accomplished in the <code>Marker</code> object's
            <code>prepareForMove</code> method.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Randomly choose a number of <code>steps</code>, either 0, 1, or 2. Each of these should be
            equally likely over the long haul. Similarly to <code>direction</code>, this is done in
            the <code>Marker</code>'s' <code>prepareForMove</code> method.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <code>Marker</code> object's <code>direction</code> and <code>steps</code> properties
            give us information about where the marker will move next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to move the red marker using <code>Marker</code>'s <code>move</code> method. If that move
            would take you off the grid, go back to Step 1 without moving the marker. Store each successful
            move's coordinates within a <code>Cell</code> object inside <code>Marker</code>'s'
            <code>history</code> array.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>
        After the simulation is complete, the following will be displayed below the animation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Number of step one executions</li>
        <li>Reason why game ended</li>
        <li>Grid indicating number of times each cell was touched</li>
        <li>Maximum number of touches for any cell</li>
        <li>Minimum number of touches for any cell</li>
        <li>Average number of touches for any cell</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This information is contained within a <code>Result</code> object, and the majority of the
        data, apart from <code>stepOneExecs</code> is processed after the game ends.
      </p>
